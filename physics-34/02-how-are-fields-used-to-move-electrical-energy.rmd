# How are fields used to move electrical energy

## Electromagnetic induction

| name                      | symbol        | units     |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| Area of loop              | $A$           | $(m^2)$   |
| Magnetic field strength   | $B$           | $(T)$     |
| Magnetic flux             | $\Phi$        | $(Wb)$    |
| Electromotive force (EMF) | $\varepsilon$ | $(V)$     |
| Length of wire            | $l$           | $(m)$     |
| Velocity of wire          | $v$           | $(ms^-1)$ |

**Magnetic flux** is the number of magnetic field lines passing through a surface (such as a loop of wire)

$$\Phi=B_\perp{A}$$

**Faraday's Law** states that an EMF is generated in a current carrying loop equal to the negative rate of change of magnetic flux

Rotating loop in a magnetic field

$$\varepsilon=n\frac{\Delta{\Phi}}{\Delta{t}}$$

Wire moving in a magnetic field

$$\varepsilon=Blv$$

**Lenz's Law** states that the direction of the induced current is such that the magnetic field of the current opposes the direction of the change in magnetic field.

**Slip ring** is used to connect the loop to the rest of the circuit resulting in a continuous AC (alternating current)

**Split ring commutator** reverses the direction of the current every half turn, flipping all the negative currents into positive currents making DC (direct current)

**RMS voltage** is the equivalent DC voltage that produces the same power in a load as the corresponding AC voltage

$$V_{RMS}=\frac{V_{peak}}{\sqrt{2}}$$

$$I_{RMS}=\frac{I_{peak}}{\sqrt{2}}$$

## Power Transmission

| name            | symbol     | units      |
| --------------- | ---------- | ---------- |
| Current         | $I$        | $(A)$      |
| Voltage         | $V$        | $(V)$      |
| Number of loops | $n$        |            |
| Number of loops | $R$        | $(\Omega)$ |
| Power loss      | $P_{loss}$ | $(W)$      |

**Transformers** is used to increase/decrease the voltage in a current to reduce power loss when transmitting power and it only works with AC Current.

$$\frac{I_s}{I_p}=\frac{V_p}{V_s}=\frac{n_p}{n_s}$$

Power

$$P=VI$$

Ohms Law

$$V=IR$$

Power loss

$$P_{loss}=I^2R=\frac{V^2}{R}$$
