## special relativity

### frame of reference

frame of reference is a set of physical reference points that uniquely fix (locate and orient) the coordinate system and standardize measurements.

### inertial frame of reference

inertial frame of reference is a frame of reference that is not accelerating

### speed of light

the speed of light $c$ is constant in all frame of reference

$$c=3*10^8ms^{-1}$$

### time dilation

### length contraction
